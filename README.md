### Example Usage Scenario

Imagine you are managing a simple text database for storing notes or records. You can use this script to:

- **Add Data**: Quickly add new records to the database.
- **Edit Data**: Modify existing records easily when updates are needed.
- **Search Data**: Find specific records or notes using keywords.
- **See Database**: View all records to review the stored information.

This program provides a basic but effective way to manage text data, especially useful for simple record-keeping or note-taking tasks. You can run it on any device with Python installed and store your data in the specified text file (`/sdcard/database_data.txt`).
